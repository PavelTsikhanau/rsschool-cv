## **`Briefly About Myself:`** 
I have been fond of sports since childhood and for 15 years I was a member of the national team of Belarus in modern pentathlon.
Sport brought up in me purposefulness, diligence, responsibility, striving for excellence, communication skills.
Now I have decided to change the field of activity and I am sure that the skills that I have acquired during my sports career will help me reach heights in the field of Front-end Development.
